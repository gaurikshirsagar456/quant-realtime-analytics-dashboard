ChatGPT Usage Transparency Statement

This project was developed with the assistance of ChatGPT as an AI support tool.

Purpose of AI Usage:
ChatGPT was used to support understanding, planning, and implementation of the project. The AI acted as a coding and documentation assistant, not as an autonomous developer.

How ChatGPT Was Used:
- Clarifying project requirements and expected architecture
- Designing system architecture and data flow (backend, analytics, frontend)
- Assisting with backend code structure (FastAPI, WebSocket ingestion, database integration)
- Helping implement quantitative analytics such as regression, Z-score, and ADF tests
- Supporting frontend UI improvements and component structuring
- Debugging errors and suggesting fixes during development
- Drafting documentation and explanatory notes

Prompts Used (Examples):
- “Generate architecture diagram for a real-time quant analytics system”
- “Explain and implement hedge ratio and Z-score analytics”
- “Fix Streamlit / React UI issues and improve layout”
- “Provide FastAPI endpoint for CSV export”
- “Suggest clean UI styling for dashboard components”

Human Contribution:
All final design decisions, code integration, testing, validation, and submission were performed by the author. AI-generated suggestions were reviewed, modified, and adapted as needed.

Limitations:
ChatGPT outputs were treated as guidance and not blindly copied. Manual verification and customization were applied to ensure correctness and alignment with project goals.

Declaration:
This project complies with academic and professional integrity guidelines. AI was used transparently as a productivity and learning aid.
